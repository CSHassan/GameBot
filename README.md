Ankou Killer: Runescape Script

This is a java script I made for a game called RuneScape. This was my original and first programming project which I learn by piecing together code from multiple sources and watching hours and hours of video.

Original developed in around 2011-2012 , it was maintained for a couple of years when I decided to monetise it by selling it online to friends and eventually other players.The basic algorithm of this script was this:

1) Attack a certain monster within an area that have the same code as supplied (by the GUI which gave multiple monster options)

2) eat food / heal if the character goes below a certain Health points 

3) Pick up any loot (things that monster in the game drop which included common item to rare items) and store in the inventory

4) Use special attack , magic to regain food and kill enemy monster quickly 

5) Act like human movements so it doesnâ€™t get detected by the games anti-bot function.
