This is a java script I made for a game called RuneScape. This was my original and first programming project which I learn by piecing together code from multiple sources and watching hours and hours of video.

Original developed in around 2011-2012 , it was maintained for a couple of years when I decided to monetise it by selling it online to friends and eventually other players.The basic algorithm of this script was this:

1) Attack a certain monster within an area that have the same code as supplied (by the GUI which gave multiple monster options)
2) eat food / heal if the character goes below a certain Health points 
3) Pick up any loot (things that monster in the game drop which included common item to rare items) and store in the inventory
